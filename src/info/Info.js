I highly recommend using a gradient generator like https://gradientgenerator.paytonpierce.dev/ to generate a pair of colors that you like.
These colors will be used to style your name on the homepage, the background of your picture, and some other accents throughout
the site.

So let's get started! Some of the info below is pretty self-explanatory, like 'firstName' and 'bio'. I'll try to explain anything
that might not be obvious right off the bat :) I recommend looking at the template example live using "npm start" to get an idea
of what each of the values mean.

    bio: "Hey, I'm Pat.  As a lifelong tinkerer with a passion for both computers and cycling, I am constantly seeking out new challenges to tackle. My extensive experience in solving complex problems in the cycling world has honed my ability to think critically and find creative solutions. Now, as I shift my focus to the tech world, I am eager to apply these same problem-solving skills to software development. I approach each project, no matter how big or small, with enthusiasm and a commitment to finding the best possible solution. Whether working independently or collaborating with a team, I am always eager to take on the next puzzle and push myself to new heights.",
